[2026-02-23 17:24:37 CST] Phase 1 kickoff
- Created project module folders: backend/, workers/, frontend/, skill/, docs/, config/.
- Added foundation docs: architecture, data model, draft SQL schema.
- Added environment contracts: .env.example + config/env.contract.md.
- Learning: keep raw scraped data references (raw_payload_ref/notes_ref) separate from AI-derived analyses for auditability and prompt regression debugging.
- Learning: enforce explainability in schema early (rationale + confidence) so comparison UX is grounded from day one.

[2026-02-23 17:26:13 CST] Phase 2 started (ingestion skeleton)
- Added workers package with Scrapling-based GitHub ingestor skeleton.
- Added typed config parsing + MONITORED_REPOS URL validation/dedup.
- Added normalized event models and analysis output schema (change_type, impact, confidence, rationale).
- Added workers run entrypoint and setup docs.
- Learning: URL validation at config boundary prevents noisy runtime failures in worker loops.
- Learning: using typed schemas for analysis output early makes later OpenAI JSON-mode integration safer.
